# ChlorineConcentration

This data set was introduced in a PhD thesis by Lei Li (see [1]. It was produced by EPANET, a software application that models the hydraulic and water quality behavior of water distribution piping systems. EPANET can track, in a given water network the water level and pressure in each tank, the water flow in the pipes and the concentration of a chemical species (chlorine in this case) throughout the network within a simulated duration.

Each time series is the measurements of the chlorine concentration level at 166 nodes (pipe junctions). The measurements were taken every 5 minutes over 15 days.

Train size: 467

Test size: 3840

Missing value: No

该数据集由李磊在一篇博士论文中介绍（见[1]它由EPANET生成，该软件应用程序模拟配水管道系统的水力和水质行为。EPANET可以在模拟的持续时间内，在给定的水网中跟踪每个水箱中的水位和压力、管道中的水流以及整个水网中化学物质（本例中为氯）的浓度。
每个时间序列都是166个节点（管道接头）处氯浓度水平的测量值。在15天内每5分钟进行一次测量。

训练大小：467
