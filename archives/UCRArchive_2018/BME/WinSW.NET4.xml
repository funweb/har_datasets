 This is an example of a minimal Windows Service Wrapper configuration, which includes only mandatory options.
 
 This configuration file should be placed near the WinSW executable, the name should be the same.
 E.g. for myapp.exe the configuration file name should be myapp.xml
 
 You can find more information about the configuration options here: https://github.com/kohsuke/winsw/blob/master/doc/xmlConfigFile.md
